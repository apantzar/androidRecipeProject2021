            "exec": " Boil the potatoes in a saucepan of salted water for 15–20 minutes until just tender. Drain and leave until cool enough to handle, then cut the potatoes into slices. Beat the eggs in a bowl with salt and pepper to taste. Heat the oil in a deep non-stick frying pan over a low heat, add the onion and diced potatoes, and saute for 10–15 minutes, stirring frequently, until soft and golden. Preheat the grill to hot. Add the eggs to the frying pan, and cook undisturbed for 5 minutes or until the eggs are just beginning to set in the center. Slide the frying pan under the hot grill, and cook for a few minutes until the top is golden brown. Serve the omelette hot or cold, cut into wedges."
